# Bioinformatics
Decoding DNA, Genome Sequencing and more....

### Description:
This project provides a toolkit for studying bioinformatics using Python. Functions offered by the toolkit can be applied to solve a range of bioinformatic problems, such as finding replication origins and regulation motifs, sequencing an antibiotic peptide, and constructing DNA using Eulerian/De Bruijn graph.
